# One-Group ANOVA method between two sample groups

The authors surveyed two independent sample groups of senior and junior experts for expert elicitation. The snowball sampling method was selected to identify senior experts for elicitation [1]. The sampling of junior researchers included snowball sampling and also structured survey aimed at final-year undergraduate nuclear engineering students at Hacettepe University. Therefore, the sample group of junior experts (`N=62`) is larger than the sample group of senior experts (`N=23`). The One-Group ANOVA method was used between the sample groups to compare the level of perceptions of participants [2]. Likert scale is used to quantify the perception levels (`Significantly disagree=1`, `Disagree=2`, `Neither disagree nor agree=3`, `Agree=4`, `Significantly agree=5`) for statistical analysis using psych package in R [3].
